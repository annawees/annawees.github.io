description: From the state of Tlaxcala in Mexico, Sopa de Tortilla is a staple in Mexican and Tex-Mex kitchens. *Caldo de pollo* (chicken stock) builds complexity with roasted tomatoes, pasilla, and chipotle peppers. Crisp tortillas, melted queso de chihuaha, fresh cilantro and silky avocados accent this falvorful broth and deliver a complexity in textures, and contrast in flavors.
