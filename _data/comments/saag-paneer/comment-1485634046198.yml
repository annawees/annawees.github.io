  This was a huge hit with the whole family. Very quick and easy to cook. My
  yogurt curdled a bit when I added it to the spinach so next time I will make
  sure to cool the spinach mixture a bit more before adding the yogurt. I served
  with with some naan bread and everyone loved it. I will definitely get this
  one again.
