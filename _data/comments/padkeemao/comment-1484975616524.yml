  This dish was well received by my family. We ended up using just half of the
  fish sauce because we were nervous it would have been way too much for our
  taste (just opening the container of fish sauce stunk up my kitchen). This
  makes a large amount of food. I bought enough for 4 people and fed a family of
  5 with leftovers!
